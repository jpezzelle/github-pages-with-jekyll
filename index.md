I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about lots of issues that have been bugging me lately. I don't like complainers so I'll usually just bring some material to the table and open the discussion to ways it might be improved. Really just strange encounters I find here in Albuquerque and the stuff I would usually say to myself.
